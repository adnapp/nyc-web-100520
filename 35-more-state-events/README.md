- How many components? 
 - i dont know 
 - Components are suppose to be either/or reusable/single responsibility 

- `key` prop
- rendering a list in the sibling container
- Conditionals

render(){
let randomVariable
if(this.props.x.isEven?){
  randomVariable = x*2
}else if(x.isOdd?){
  randomVariable = x*3
}


  return (
    {randomVariable}
  )
}
